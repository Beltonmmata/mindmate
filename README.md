# **MindMate — Mental Health Support Platform**

*A full-stack wellness application offering anonymous emotional support, journaling, and guidance.*

---

## ## 🧠 **Problem Statement**

Modern students and young adults silently struggle with stress, anxiety, burnout, academic pressure, relationship challenges, and loneliness.
Yet most avoid seeking help because of:

* **Stigma** around mental health
* **Fear of judgment** from peers, teachers, or family
* **High cost** of therapy
* **Lack of accessible, youth-friendly support systems**
* **No safe space** to express emotions anonymously

Across campuses, these issues continue to rise despite the availability of mainstream counselling services — mostly because users don’t feel ready to “speak to a real person”.

MindMate solves this.
